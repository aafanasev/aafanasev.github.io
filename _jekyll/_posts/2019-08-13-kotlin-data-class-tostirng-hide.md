*This post describes how to remove class properties from `toString()` method manually if you don't want to use [Sekret]({% post_url 2019-08-13-sekret %}) library.*

### 1. Override toString() by yourself

The simplest way how you can hide sensitive information is overriding `toString`. 
But it always needs an additional work in every class. What if you want to show other properties? You will have to concatenate strings by yourself. 

```kotlin
data class Data(
    val login: String,
    val password: String 
) {
    override fun toString() = ""
}
```

### 2. Define variable out of Data class

In this case the property won't be included to any of autogenerated functions of data classes (toString, hashCode, equals, components, etc)

```kotlin
data class Data(
    val login: String
) {
    var password: String
}

// Usage - instantiate and set
val data = Data("login")
data.password = "password"
```

### 3. Use a wrapper class

This one is more elegant solution but when you create/read a data you will have 1 more level of abstraction.

```kotlin
// Wrapper
class Secret<T>(val data: T) {
    override fun toString() = ""
}

data class Data(
    val login: String,
    val password: Secret<String>
)

// Usage - create / read
val data = Data("login", Secret("password"))
data.password.data
```

### 4. Do not use Data classes ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

In this case you will not have all advantages of data classes. 

```kotlin
class Data(
    val login: String,
    val password: String
)
```
